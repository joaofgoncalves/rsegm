meanshift_segmenter(

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{SpatRaster}} with 1 or more
bands.}

\item{spatialr}{Integer \eqn{\ge 1}. Spatial radius (in pixels) of the local
neighborhood used during mean-shift filtering. Larger values increase
spatial smoothing and runtime.}

\item{ranger}{Positive numeric. Range bandwidth controlling how strongly
pixels are weighted by spectral similarity during mean-shift filtering.
Smaller values preserve edges more aggressively; larger values smooth more.}

\item{max_iter}{Integer \eqn{\ge 1}. Maximum number of mean-shift iterations
per pixel.}

\item{eps}{Positive numeric. Convergence tolerance for the mean-shift update.
Iteration stops when the squared shift is \eqn{\le eps^2}.}

\item{merge_thr}{Optional numeric threshold used during clustering of the
filtered image. Neighboring pixels whose filtered spectral distance is
\eqn{\le merge\_thr} are connected. If \code{NA} (default), the C++ routine
uses \code{0.5 * ranger}.}

\item{min_size}{Integer \eqn{\ge 1}. Minimum segment size (in pixels).
Components smaller than \code{min_size} are merged into the most similar
neighboring component (based on filtered spectral distance).}

\item{eight}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses 8-neighborhood connectivity for
clustering and also includes diagonal offsets in the mean-shift spatial
neighborhood. If \code{FALSE}, uses 4-neighborhood.}

\item{scale_bands}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), standardizes each band
to z-scores \code{(x - mean) / sd} using \code{na.rm = TRUE}. This is often
recommended for multispectral imagery with bands in different numeric
ranges.}

\item{smooth}{Integer \eqn{\ge 0}. Optional mean filter window size (pixels)
applied to the raster prior to mean-shift. If \code{0} (default), no
pre-smoothing is applied. If \code{> 0}, a \code{smooth x smooth} mean
filter is applied via \code{\link[terra:focal]{terra::focal()}}.}

\item{return_filtered}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), returns only the
segmentation labels raster. If \code{TRUE}, also returns the filtered
multi-band raster produced by mean-shift.}

\item{output_file}{Optional character string. If provided, the resulting
segmentation raster is written to this file via
\code{\link[terra:writeRaster]{terra::writeRaster()}}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages from the R
wrapper. If \code{FALSE}, runs quietly and suppresses console output from
the underlying C++ routine.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_filtered = FALSE}, a single-layer
\code{\link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{SpatRaster}} of integer segment labels
named \code{"segment_id"}.

If \code{return_filtered = TRUE}, a list with:
\describe{
\item{\code{segments}}{Single-layer labels \code{SpatRaster}.}
\item{\code{filtered}}{Multi-layer \code{SpatRaster} with the mean-shift
  filtered bands (same number of layers as \code{x}).}
}
}
\description{
Performs image segmentation using a **mean-shift filtering + clustering**
approach on multi-band rasters (RGB or multispectral).
}
\details{
The method first applies mean-shift *range filtering* (edge-preserving
smoothing) in a local spatial neighborhood, then groups pixels into
connected components based on similarity of the filtered values. Small
components can be merged into the most similar neighboring component.

This is a high-level R wrapper around a C++ implementation optimized for
raster grids and multi-band imagery.


**Algorithm outline (C++ implementation):**

\enumerate{
\item \strong{Validity mask:} A pixel is marked invalid if any band is
\code{NA} or not finite. Invalid pixels receive label \code{0} in C++ and
are converted to \code{NA} in the output raster.

\item \strong{Mean-shift filtering:} For each valid pixel, the algorithm
iteratively updates a spectral vector \eqn{y} using a weighted mean of the
local neighborhood within \code{spatialr}. The weight is a product of:
\itemize{
  \item a Gaussian \emph{spatial} kernel (sigma \eqn{\approx spatialr/2}), and
  \item a Gaussian \emph{range} kernel based on spectral distance with
  bandwidth \code{ranger}.
}
Iteration stops after \code{max_iter} steps or when the update magnitude is
below \code{eps}.

\item \strong{Clustering:} The filtered image is clustered by building
connected components on the grid. Neighboring pixels are linked when the
squared distance between their filtered spectral vectors is below
\code{merge_thr^2}. Connectivity follows \code{eight}.

\item \strong{Minimum size enforcement:} Components smaller than
\code{min_size} are merged into the most similar neighboring component using
local neighbor search.

\item \strong{Relabeling:} Components are relabeled to consecutive integers
\code{1..K}. Invalid pixels remain \code{NA} in the R output.
}

Internally, pixel values are passed to C++ in a band-major layout
(all pixels of band 1, then all pixels of band 2, ...). The wrapper handles
the conversion from \code{terra} values.

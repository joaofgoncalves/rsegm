Description: Tools for classical object-based image analysis (OBIA) segmentation of
        geospatial rasters (e.g., satellite and UAV imagery), including region growing,
        Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher (FH), and mean-shift based approaches, with optional
        tiled processing and seam-aware merging for large images.
